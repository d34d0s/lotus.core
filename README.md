## Building the Engine Source üõ†Ô∏è
(**NOTE**): Using the `CBuild` CLI build-tool requires you to have python installed! More info can be found on the [CBuild Repository](https://github.com/d34d0s/CBuild)

Lotus now includes pre-configured `.cbuild` files for easy setup and compilation! Users are encouraged to use the **[CBuild](https://github.com/d34d0s/CBuild)** CLI tool, which is lightweight and tailored for projects like Lotus Core.


### Option 1: Build with CBuild (Recommended)

1. **Install CBuild**:  
   Install the tool via PyPI:
   ```bash
   pip install cbuild
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/d34d0s/Lotus.git
   cd Lotus
   ```

3. **Build the Engine**:  
   Use the provided `.cbuild` configuration to build Lotus:  
   ```bash
   cbuild lotus.cbuild
   ```

4. **Output**:  
   The compiled `Lotus.dll` will be located in the `build/lotus.core` directory.

<br>

### Option 2: Manual Compilation

If you prefer manual setup, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/d34d0s/Lotus.git
   cd Lotus
   ```

2. **Compile the Engine**:  
   Use GCC to build Lotus:  
   ```bash
   gcc -c lotus/lotus.core/*.c -Ilotus/include -DLOTUS_EXPORT -o build/lotus.core/*.o
   gcc -shared build/lotus.core/*.o -lopengl32 -lgdi32 -o build/lotus.core/Lotus.dll
   ```

3. **Install the Compiled Binaries**:  
   Move the compiled files to your project's directories as needed:  
   ```bash
   cp build/lotus.core/Lotus.dll your_project/bin/
   ```

<br>

## Building Projects with Lotus

1. **Prepare Your Project**:  
   Set up your source files and include paths.

2. **Compile with CBuild or GCC**:  
   - Example using GCC:  
     ```bash
     gcc my_project.c -Ilotus/include -lLotus -o my_project.exe
     ```
